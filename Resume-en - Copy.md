- **Microsoft China, m365 department, 2020.6~2021.4**

   Big data platform user/cluster anomaly detection
   
   Data lineage system based on static analysis of scope syntax tree
   

## <img src="assets/project-diagram-solid.svg" width="30px"> Research

- Two CCF-A conference papers

- Unsupervised Human Activity Representation Learning with Multi-task Deep Clustering (**UbiComp 2020**)

  - Constructed multi-task unsupervised deep clustering for human activity recognition
  - The model obtains hidden layer representations through joint learning of the three tasks of clustering, classification and auto-encoding
  - The model can surpass mainstream unsupervised methods without labels, and the performance of supervised algorithms can be approximated by fine-tuning with a small number of labels
  
- AttnSense: Multi-level Attention Mechanism For Multimodal Human Activity Recognition (**Ijcai 2019**)

  - Human behavior recognition in multi-modal scenes
  
  - Dynamic fusion of multi-modal sensor signals is carried out through the self attention model
  
## <img src="assets/tools-solid.svg" width="30px"> Project

- Big data cluster anomaly detection

  - Policy-based detection and alarm, alarm merging mechanism

  - PCA-based user behavior anomaly detection and blackout

  - Cluster node abnormality detection, such as task blocking, job failure rate is too high

- Accelerate the performance of spark MLlib algorithm based on Intel MKL (undergraduate completion)

  - Implemented PCA, ALS, Logistic Regression and other algorithms through MKL
  
- NJU-ProjectN

  - Implement a complete pipeline CPU, c language subset compiler, MIPS simulator and simple operating system
  
  - Run the MIPS CPU, x86 hardware simulator, operating system, and compiler implemented by yourself on FPGA, and compile and run Legend of Sword and Fairy
  
- Some small project

  - Machine learning algorithms implemented in python, such as decision trees, naive Bayes
  
  - Parallel machine learning algorithms implemented by libraries such as MPI and cuda
  
  - High-performance KV storage, lsm tree based storage engine
  
  - Use Nlp technology to analyze Jin Yong's novels, implement a multi-label clustering algorithm, and display the relationship diagram of Jin Yong's novels
