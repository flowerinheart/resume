- Master, Nanjing University, Computer Science and Technology, 2017.9~2020.7

- Bachelor, Nanjing University, Computer Science and Technology, 2013.9~2017.7


## <img src="assets/briefcase-solid.svg" width="30px"> Experience

- **Microsoft China, m365 department, 2020.6~2021.4**

   Big data platform user/cluster anomaly detection
   
   Data lineage system based on static analysis of scope syntax tree

## <img src="assets/project-diagram-solid.svg" width="30px"> Research

- Two CCF-A conference papers

- Unsupervised Human Activity Representation Learning with Multi-task Deep Clustering (**UbiComp 2020**)

  - Constructed multi-task unsupervised deep clustering for human activity recognition
  - The model obtains hidden layer representations through joint learning of the three tasks of clustering, classification and auto-encoding
  - The model can surpass mainstream unsupervised methods without labels, and the performance of supervised algorithms can be approximated by fine-tuning with a small number of labels
  
- AttnSense: Multi-level Attention Mechanism For Multimodal Human Activity Recognition (**Ijcai 2019**)

  - Human behavior recognition in multi-modal scenes
  
  - Dynamic fusion of multi-modal sensor signals is carried out through the self attention model
## <img src="assets/tools-solid.svg" width="30px"> Project

- Big data cluster anomaly detection

  - Policy-based detection and alarm, alarm merging mechanism

  - PCA-based user behavior anomaly detection and blackout

  - Cluster node abnormality detection, such as task blocking, job failure rate is too high
- Accelerate the performance of spark MLlib algorithm based on Intel MKL (undergraduate completion)

  - Implemented PCA, ALS, Logistic Regression and other algorithms through MKL
- Humor Generation and Classification
  - Use GPT2-chinese and fine-tuning through humor dataset to generate Chinese jokes
  - Use BERT and Fine-Tuned classifiers to train on the generated joke dataset for classification
- Analysis of the relationship between characters in Jin Yong's novels
  - Based on jieba word segmentation and CRF-based named entity recognition method to identify characters, gangs, weapons, etc. in Jin Yong’s novels
  - Use multi-label propagation algorithm to construct person relationship graph, entity relationship extraction and analysis of the relationship between entities
- Some small project

  - Machine learning algorithms implemented in python, such as decision trees, naive Bayes
  
  - Parallel machine learning algorithms implemented by libraries such as MPI and cuda
  
  - High-performance KV storage, lsm tree based storage engine
